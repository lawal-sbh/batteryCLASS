# CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Battery Energy Storage Systems in Modern Grids

BESS deployment has grown exponentially, with global capacity reaching 28GW in 2023 (IEA, 2023). Key applications include:

- **Energy arbitrage**: Capitalizing on price differentials (Zhou et al., 2021)
- **Frequency response**: FFR, Dynamic Containment services (NG ESO, 2023)
- **Congestion management**: Constraint cost reduction (Pudjianto et al., 2022)
- **Inertia emulation**: Synthetic inertia provision (Yazdani et al., 2023)

## 2.2 UK Electricity Market Structure

The UK operates one of the world's most complex electricity markets:

### Balancing Mechanism (BM)
- Real-time balancing with 30-minute settlement periods
- £4.2bn market volume annually (Elexon, 2023)
- Price spikes exceeding £4,000/MWh during constraints

### Ancillary Services
- **Frequency Response**: FFR, Dynamic Containment, Moderation
- **Balancing Services**: STOR, Fast Reserve
- **Constraint Management**: £1.8bn annual costs (NG ESO, 2023)

### Network Charges
- **BSUoS**: Balancing System Use of System charges
- **TEC**: Transmission Entry Capacity rates
- **Locational pricing**: Significant regional variations

## 2.3 Reinforcement Learning in Energy Applications

RL has emerged as a powerful approach for energy system optimization:

- **Single-agent RL**: Price forecasting and arbitrage (Chen et al., 2022)
- **Multi-agent RL**: Coordinated storage dispatch (Zhang et al., 2023)
- **Deep RL**: Complex policy learning in high-dimensional spaces (Wang et al., 2023)

**Research Gap**: Limited application of hierarchical RL for multi-timescale battery dispatch.

## 2.4 Multi-Objective Optimization in Power Systems

Multi-objective approaches balance competing objectives:

- **Weighted sum methods**: Simple but limited (Kim & Powell, 2021)
- **Pareto optimization**: Multiple optimal solutions (Li et al., 2022)
- **Constraint method**: Convert objectives to constraints (Zhou et al., 2023)

**Research Gap**: Inadequate treatment of public grid services as optimization objectives.

## 2.5 Hierarchical Control Architectures

Hierarchical control decomposes complex problems:

- **Two-level optimization**: Day-ahead scheduling with real-time adjustments (Zhou et al., 2022)
- **Model Predictive Control**: Receding horizon optimization (Morari et al., 2023)
- **Multi-agent systems**: Distributed decision making (Zhang et al., 2023)

**Research Gap**: Limited integration of hierarchical control with RL for battery dispatch.

## 2.6 Research Gap Identification

This thesis addresses three critical gaps:

1. **Temporal coordination**: Integrated day-ahead and real-time decision making
2. **Public-private balance**: Simultaneous optimization of economic and stability objectives  
3. **UK market specificity**: Tailored solutions for complex UK market structure
4. **Portfolio coordination**: Multi-location battery optimization
