# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 The UK Energy Transition Challenge

The UK power system faces a critical juncture characterized by three simultaneous challenges:

### The Renewables Integration Challenge
- **40% renewable penetration** (2023) with limited dispatchability
- **£1.8bn annual constraint costs** from curtailment and redispatch (NG ESO, 2023)
- **Scottish constraints**: 62% of constraint costs occur in Scotland

### The System Stability Challenge  
- **30% inertia reduction** since 2013 due to thermal plant retirements
- **Frequency stability risks** with RoCoF exceeding 0.5 Hz/s during incidents
- **Voltage management challenges** in weak grid areas

### The Market Complexity Challenge
- **Balancing Mechanism**: £4.2bn annual market with 30-minute settlements
- **Ancillary services**: FFR, Dynamic Containment, Moderation markets
- **Network charges**: BSUoS, TEC with significant locational variations

## 1.2 The Battery Storage Opportunity

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) offer unique capabilities:

**Private Value Streams:**
- Energy arbitrage (price differential capture)
- Frequency response services (£12-23/MW/h)
- Capacity market payments

**Public Value Services:**
- Congestion management through locational dispatch
- Synthetic inertia provision during frequency events
- Voltage support and black start capability

## 1.3 The Research Gap

Current approaches fail to capture the full value potential:

1. **Single-Objective Focus**: Maximize profit OR provide grid services
2. **Temporal Disconnect**: Day-ahead and real-time decisions uncoordinated
3. **Portfolio Myopia**: Individual battery optimization ignores coordination benefits
4. **Market Complexity**: UK-specific market structures poorly addressed

## 1.4 Research Questions

### Main Research Question
**"How can hierarchical reinforcement learning enable UK battery portfolios to simultaneously maximize commercial revenue and provide critical grid stability services?"**

### Sub-Research Questions

**RQ1: Architectural Effectiveness**  
*Can a two-level hierarchical architecture effectively manage multi-timescale battery dispatch decisions?*

**RQ2: Multi-Objective Optimization**  
*How can reward functions balance economic profit against grid stability services?*

**RQ3: UK Market Relevance**  
*To what extent does the framework address specific UK challenges like constraint costs?*

**RQ4: Public-Private Value**  
*What is the quantifiable value proposition of coordinated battery dispatch?*

**RQ5: Practical Deployability**  
*What are the requirements for real-world deployment?*

## 1.5 Research Objectives

1. Design and implement a hierarchical RL architecture for UK battery dispatch
2. Develop multi-objective reward functions balancing economic and stability objectives
3. Validate framework performance with UK market-calibrated scenarios
4. Quantify public-private value proposition across different locations
5. Demonstrate portfolio coordination benefits and deployment pathway

## 1.6 Scope and Limitations

### Scope
- Focus on UK electricity markets and grid codes
- 2-battery portfolio for proof-of-concept
- Calibrated synthetic data with real-market patterns
- 24-hour operational horizon

### Limitations
- Synthetic data (though calibrated to public reports)
- Simplified grid representation
- 2-battery portfolio (scalable but not fully demonstrated)
- Assumed perfect forecasts (day-ahead)

## 1.7 Thesis Contributions

### Theoretical Contributions
- Novel hierarchical RL framework for multi-timescale decision making
- Multi-objective optimization methodology for public-private value balance
- Quantitative framework for stability service valuation

### Practical Contributions
